## How to contribute
**Create a pull request, note that the changes have to go through a verification process**
- The texture must be SFW
- The texture should not have any "watermark" referring the user that makes the change. (We will credit you whenever we do stable releases) 
- The texture must be based of mkwii (no big changes, nor "personal" texture)
- The texture must be under 4096x4096px (we will decrease the resolution if necessary)

**You can also join the discord and ask there**
